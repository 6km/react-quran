This could not have been achieved without the grace of AllƒÅh, who helped us to do this, and then the valuable resources that help achieve digital solutions for Muslims and Islam. May allah bless them with His mercy. While not all resources used during development are remembered, here are the ones that come to mind.

- [King Fahd Glorious Qur'an Printing Complex](https://qurancomplex.gov.sa/techquran/dev/)
  for providing the Uthmani font of the Qur'ƒÅn and data of the verses and chapters.
- [Quran.com](https://quran.com/)
  for providing their useful API which is used to get verses of the Qur'ƒÅn line-by-line.
- [Tanzil](https://tanzil.net/)
  for providing a lot of valudable data such as Qur'ƒÅn text
